								<h2>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-info">
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The basic commitment of a professional international center is to search for and to communicate the truth, as it is honestly perceived. ALL IN ONE-BENIN could not accomplish its purpose in the absence of this demanding standard. To the extent that this standard is respected, a genuine learning community can exist. Students of this training center are called upon to know, to respect, and to practice this standard of personal honesty. <br><strong>Plagiarism is a serious form of violation of this standard. Plagiarism is the appropriation for gain of ideas, language, or work of another without sufficient public acknowledgement and appropriate citation that the material is not one's own.</strong> It is true that every thought probably has been influenced to some degree by the thoughts and actions of others. Such influences can be thought of as affecting the ways we see things and express all thoughts. <strong>Plagiarism, however, involves the deliberate taking and use of specific words and ideas of others without proper acknowledgement of the sources.</strong> The staff and administration of ALL IN ONE-BENIN wish to make it clear that the following acts are regarded as serious violations of personal honesty and the professional training ideal that binds ALL IN ONE-BENIN into a learning community:
									<br>
									Submitting as one's own: </p>
									<ol>
										<blockquote>
											<li>Material copied from a published source: print, internet, CD-ROM, audio, video, etc.</li>
											<li>Another person's unpublished work or examination material.</li>
											<li>Allowing another or paying another to write or research a paper for one's own benefit.</li>
											<li>Purchasing, acquiring, and using for course credit a pre-written paper.</li>
										</blockquote>
									</ol>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The critical issue is to give proper recognition to other sources. To do so is both an act of personal, professional courtesy and of intellectual honesty. Plagiarism on the part of a student in academic work or dishonest examination behavior will result minimally in the instructor assigning the grade of "F" for the assignment or examination. In addition, all instances of academic dishonesty must be reported to the Director of ALL IN ONE-BENIN. The Director may constitute a hearing board to consider the imposition of sanctions in addition to those imposed by the instructor, including a recommendation of expulsion, depending upon the seriousness of the misconduct. Academic cheating is another serious act that violates academic integrity. Obtaining, distributing, or communicating examination materials prior to the scheduled examination without the consent of the teacher; providing information to or obtaining information from another student during the examination; attempting to change answers after the examination has been submitted; and falsifying medical or other documents to petition for excused absences all are violations of the integrity and honesty standards of the examination process. In the case of multiple instances of academic dishonesty, the administration of ALL IN ONE-BENIN may convene a hearing board. Students retain the right to appeal the decision of the hearing board to the academic dean of the college in which they are registered. The decision of the Director is final in all cases. The sanction of expulsion for academic dishonesty may be imposed only by the Director upon recommendation of the staff.
